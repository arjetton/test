  description: Enter tags here. Try not to go overboard with them. Use "Psalms" or
    "David" if the material is centrally about that text or that person, not if they're
    mentioned tangentially. (Presumably all lessons and articles are ultimately about
    God, but tagging every post with "God" would make that tag a bit pointless.)
